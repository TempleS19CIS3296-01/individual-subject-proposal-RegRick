# Project Description

Utility rates can fluctuate wildly throughtout a given day. During peak hours (dusk/evening), rates can be more than 25% higher than the daily average. By simply reducing consumption during peak hours, consumers can save substantial amounts on power bills. The Utility Rate Monitor application will provide a simple interface with which users can compare their power consumption to their utility's rate in (near)real time, analyze how other company's rates may affect their power-bill, and review statistics of historic power consumption. The application's primary goal is provide as much information to the consumer as possible to enable an informed decision regarding power consumption.

Rate/Consumption "comparisons" will be a simple multi-line plot, where the utility rate is superimposed over power consumption. Other lines for differing rates can be included for cross-utility comparisons. Historic data will be retained and used to provide running statistics on power consumption and rate behavior. This data will be exportable as either .pdf or .xls.
